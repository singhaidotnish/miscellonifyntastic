People called him Helpless and weak.
He made each tantrum his strength and became the symbol of amputee travel and the love of lakhs of people.
Meet Vinod and Rohini Rawat.
Vinod was only 6 years old when he lost his leg in a road accident.
He had to listen to taunts since childhood. Vinod, who was fond of playing and roaming,
swallowed the anger and pain in his mind at the age of 16 ran away from home and joined the Bombay teen challenge - an NGO.
He learned that life is not about giving up. He completed his studies with the help of this NGO and then started working there.
But the passion of roaming was completed when he met Jaipur Foot with a prosthetic leg.
What was next?
Life was not so bad.
He did many long distance bike journey's with other amputee's.
He did more than 20 marathons and did 4 big tracks during the Mount Everest Base Camp.
And he also became a part of MTV Rodies Season 2.
But his journey became even more beautiful when he met Rohini at Para Wheelchair Basketball Games in 2023.
Rohini was living with polio since childhood.
She also got a government job by playing long games.
She also wanted to roam like Vinod.
This passion made her his partner.
Today, Vinod and Rohini have become each other's strength.
They are roaming the world with prosthetic leg and wheelchair.
And they are running a mission together.
To reach the wheelchair to every need of India.
Over the last few years, they have called more than 100 people to the wheelchair and prosthetic leg along with Jaipur Foot.
Vinod and Rohini's passion proves that no problem can break us or that every problem is a challenge.
