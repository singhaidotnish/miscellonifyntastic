People called him Lachar and Bebas.
He made Hartani strong and became the symbol of amputee travel and the love of lakhs of people.
Meet Vinod and Rohini Rawat.
Vinod was only 6 years old when he lost his leg in a road accident.
He had to listen to taunts since childhood.
Vinod, who was fond of playing and roaming,
took anger and pain in his mind at the age of 16 and joined the Bombay team challenge NGO.
He learned that life is not about giving up.
He completed his studies with the help of NGO and then started working here.
But the shop-top of roaming was completed when he met Jaipur Fudh with a prosthetic leg.
What was next?
Life was not so bad.
He travelled on bike for a long time.
He did more than 20 marathons and did 4 big tracks during the Mount Everest Base Camp.
And he also became a part of MTV Rody Season 2.
But his journey became even more beautiful when he met Rohini at Para Wheelchair Basketball Games in 2023.
Rohini was living with polio since childhood.
She also got a government job by playing long games.
She also wanted to roam like Vinod.
This passion made her a partner.
Today, Vinod and Rohini have become each other's strength.
They are roaming the world with prosthetic leg and wheelchair.
And they are running a mission together.
To reach the wheelchair to every need of India.
Over the last few years, they have called more than 100 people to the wheelchair and prosthetic leg along with Jaipur Fudh.
Vinod and Rohini's passion proves that no problem can be broken by us.
